<p>It is said that " *A guest is a jewel on the cusion of hospitality!!* " and we at The Robotics Club-SNIST believe nothing less. 
We leave no stone unturned to give the best ambiance and provide best service to all our guests travelling great distances 
to come and take part in the events we conduct at the fest. 
Justifying this, the hospitality team of *#Roboveda17* is glad to announce that OYO is now the official hospitality partner for the fest.*</p>

<p>Stumagz started as an idea Charan had while he was conducting training program for students.
 He identified and witnessed first hand the advantage and potential of reaching out to students directly 
 and not through a specific advertising channel. Per Charan, this direct access is what is instrumental in reducing user acquisition costs.
stumagz2As the first step, he and his team set out to provide a platform for these students.
 “Many colleges don’t have a newsletter or a publication of any form. The ones that do, publish something sporadically.
 The need for such a platform to unite all students was obvious. Through Stumagz, we aim to give the student community a voice, 
 a place where they can express themselves – to be noticed by their peers,” says Charan. As part of this step, students can write
 stories or articles, that need to be approved by their college. Stumagz has formed a team of volunteers within each college (faculty and students)
 that are tasked with editing and approving content written by students from their college. Once approved, Stumagz publishes the story on their site.
 An extension to this is the feature, where one can create projects. A student can put up a project and the help they need – perhaps some help on Java
 coding or a front end designer. The third feature includes creating events on the website. In short: Stories, Events and Projects. A collective voice 
 that students can benefit from.</p>
