<p id="id1">Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots,[1] as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.
These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans. Robots can be used in any situation and for any purpose, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and de-activation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, and basically anything a human can do. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.

<p id="id4"> ROBOVEDA is a national level exclusive robotics symposium conducted by THE ROBOTICS CLUB-SNIST.
 Roboveda is known to conduct various robotic events with participants coming from every corner of the nation.
 ROBOVEDA’17-here’s the technical gorge yet again geared up with high spirit and verve all set to chase t
 he engineering domain of today’s technological world. With the grandeur of the success of ROBOVEDA’16,
 the team of Roboveda is again all set to take upon the intricate task of organizing technical symposium
 and to make it more triumphant and elegant than that of last year’s.ROBOVEDA’17,
 with its robotic tradition comes up to inspirit all the robotic zealots and same as the previous year,
 the event is going to be a 3-day technical gaiety sated with action and anticipation.
 The symposium would be of highest technical attribute with all the events very well upgraded which would test the technological know-how of the students.
 This 3-day event which is going to be conducted on 15th, 16th and 17th of September is expected to exert a pull on about
 5000+ participants from all over the country and we are looking forward for the amateur buds of robotics to bloom at our college
 so that we can experience the robotic whiff and savor the technicality of robotics. 
<p/><br>
<h3>The uniquely flavored events of ROBOVEDA’17 designed to test the technological expertise of the participants are presented as:</h3> 
<ul>
<li>Twelve Robotic events </li>
<li>Tech Talks </li> 
<li>Experiential  Workshops</li> 
<li>Robotic Expo</li> 
<li>Quiz</li>
<p>and Many More.. <a href="https://www.stumagz.com/roboveda-2k17" target="_block" style="color:black"><strong><mark>Register Now</mark></strong></a> Grab Early Bird Discount.</p>
